A directory of tools commonly used by web developers

At the moment, this is just a jumble of `.json` files. But the idea is that this will be imported into a database and an application will be written to search through it. The end result is one where if a developer is confused about what something (anything - libraries, tools, programs) is, they can just do a search and be provided with a description and use cases.
