### Notes

All names and languages must be in lowercase

### Languages

The primary language the platform or tool is written in. If there are more than one, pick the one which is used most often. For example, for Git, 43.8% of the code base is written in C, while 34.0% in Shell. So you'd classify git's 'language' property as 'c'.
